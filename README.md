How it works?
You call the function with a sting (the phrase you want to search) and it will return a list of titles.

Python version: 3.9
Libraries used: pytube, urllib, json

Problems:
1. Program is too slow
2. The program sometimes does't work and shows error and I'm not sure why
3. You cannot get anything other than titles of the video
