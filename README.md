How it works?
You call the function with a sting (the phrase you want to search) and it will return a list of titles.

Python version: 3.9
Libraries used: pytube, urllib, json

Problems:
1. Program is too slow
2. The program sometimes does't work and shows error and I'm not sure why
3. You cannot get anything other than titles of the video

Future Goals:
1. Make a GUI for this
2. Being able to get more things like thumbnail and channel name from the video
3. Making the code more efficient

Stuff you can help me with:
1. Please tell me why pytube's .title not work in pyton 3.9?

Anyone can use this if they want.
